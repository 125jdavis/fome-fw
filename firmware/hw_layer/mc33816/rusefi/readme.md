Source code here is different from but is heavily inspired by MC33816 example as conveniently comes with MC33816 Dev Studio.

* Hit 'Build' button in MC33816 Developer Studio to get assembly stuff in 'build' folder

* TODO what happens next? how do we get from 'build' folder to mc33816_data.c file?
